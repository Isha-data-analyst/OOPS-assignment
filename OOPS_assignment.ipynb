        "#Theoretical questions\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: OOP is a programming paradigm based on concepts of \"objects\", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of properties and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific realization of a class with actual values assigned to its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Abstraction hides complex reality behind a simple interface, while encapsulation hides the internal state and requires all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores. They are used to implement operator overloading and other special behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class. It promotes code reusability and hierarchical classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Encapsulation in Python is achieved using private attributes and methods (denoted by a single underscore) and by using property decorators to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: A constructor (__init__) is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Class methods take the class as the first argument (cls) and can modify class state that applies across all instances. Static methods do not take any specific first argument and are utility methods that don't modify class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:Python does not support method overloading by default. However, you can achieve similar functionality using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:The @property decorator allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, providing a way to control access to the class's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Polymorphism allows for more flexible and reusable code. It enables the same interface to be used for different underlying forms, promoting code maintainability and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It can define abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. It allows for the creation of complex systems in a more manageable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:A class variable is shared across all instances of the class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: __str__ returns a human-readable string representation of an object, while __repr__ returns an unambiguous string representation that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: super() is used to call methods from a parent class, allowing for method overriding and extending the functionality of parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: @staticmethod does not take any specific first argument and is a utility method. @classmethod takes the class (cls) as the first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Method chaining allows you to call multiple methods sequentially, each call returning an object that can be used as the input for the next call.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called as a function."
